# Language Performance Comparison

## Purpose

Understand the performance differences between several languages, and illustrate symantic differences between the languages.

Languages being compared:

* C# (as a baseline)

* PureScript (Node)

* Haskell


## Potential Next Steps

Haskell
 - Do Account\Transaction problem
 - Look at record syntax
 - What kind of speed to we get?

Rust?

F#?
 - Just the Dict insert?






C#

Pros
* Performance without optimization

Cons
* Large holes in logic - potential failure points


PureScript 

Pros
* Correctness
Cons
* Performance concerns on large datasets (not because of Node)
